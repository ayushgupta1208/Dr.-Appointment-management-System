#DOCTOR APPOINMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This is an online booking doctor appointment application developed using Java, JDBC, Swing, and AWT. It demonstrates my skills in Java, MySQL, and object-oriented programming concepts. The purpose of this project is to save patients' precious time by allowing them to schedule appointments through their PCs and desktops. While it is not a full-fledged project, it serves as a prototype showcasing my practical understanding in Java. Additionally, it is my minor project.
